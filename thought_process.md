(I'd either be an expert or hate it, let's find out)

After (over 1 hour of trying to understand the rules and) researching online how people built it, I got some idea from [BowlingGenius](https://www.bowlinggenius.com/), I decided to make a table with:
    
    -11 rows: 10 rows for each frames and 1 for accumulated scores. 

    -3 columns: frame 1-9 will have 2 columns for each  roll, and 10th frame will have 3 row just in case somebody really knows how to roll and strike or spare. 
 
...and I will make buttons for score input. Yay. Shut it. I am excited. Off to build the scaffold of the page.
